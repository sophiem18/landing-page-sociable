        <p>Before I found sociable, I was struggling a lot with feeling lonely. I work remotely, the rest of my company is based 3000 miles away from me. I joined run club, but it’s literally 150 people. It’s nice to make real friends that I can connect to one-on-one from here.</p>

        <p>I moved to Chicago alone last year. I loved Chicago and I thought that was enough for me to love living here but I really struggled with making friends to enjoy all the great things it has to offer. Sociable helped me make friends that wanted to share experiences with me.</p>

        <p>I literally sit in my house all day doing work. I just wanted to find some sort of community after work, people that understood me. I tried different clubs but it all felt fake. I found some genuine friends on Sociable fr. I don’t feel so isolated anymore!</p>
